   VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE
   ```

#### Step 2: Create Payment Links

1. Go to [Stripe Payment Links](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payment-links)

3. Create 4 payment links for each ticket tier:

4. Payment link opens in a new tab
5. User completes payment on Stripe's secure checkout page
6. Stripe sends confirmation email with ticket PDF
